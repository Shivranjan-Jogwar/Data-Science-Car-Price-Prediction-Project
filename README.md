# Data-Science-Car-Price-Prediction-Project

## 🚗 Car Price Prediction  
This project predicts the price of cars based on features like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. Using Machine Learning models, helps buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions.  

### 🔹 Key Features:  
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering for better predictions  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations 📊  
✅ Trained models using Regression Algorithms 
✅ Performance evaluation using RMSE & R² scores  

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
🔹 Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)  
🔹 Regression models for price prediction  

### 📌 How It Works: 
1️⃣ Load the car dataset 🚘  
2️⃣ Perform EDA & data preprocessing 🔍  
3️⃣ Train & test machine learning models 🧠  
4️⃣ Predict car prices based on input features 💰
